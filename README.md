# Gem Miner
Project for my Programming class, a very limited terraria-like game made using the Windows Presentation Foundation 
<hr>
<h2> Features: </h2>

* Mining and Gathering resources
* Placing blocks
* Crafting tools
* Seed-based Generation

<h2> The Game </h2>

Your goal is to find and collect five Legendary gems which are hidden underground. The game keeps track of your time and displays it at the end

<hr>
WPF isn't designed for videogames, which in turn makes this game very unstable and laggy, with a lot of unwanted behaviour.

Fork at <i>your own risk!
